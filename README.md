In my e-commerce project, I developed a comprehensive website that incorporates essential features for a seamless online shopping experience. Users can register and authenticate themselves, browse and search for products, manage their shopping cart, process orders, and make secure payments through integrations with popular payment gateways like PayPal.

To ensure security and user verification, I implemented fast sms OTP verification, allowing users to validate their accounts securely. Furthermore, I hosted the website on AWS using Nginx as a reverse proxy and Gunicorn as the application server. This deployment setup ensures scalability, performance, and efficient handling of incoming requests.

The website also includes order tracking functionalities, providing users with real-time updates on their orders. Additionally, responsive design techniques were employed to optimize the website for various devices, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Overall, my e-commerce project incorporates a wide range of features, from user authentication and product management to secure payments and hosting on AWS. It provides users with a secure, efficient, and enjoyable online shopping experience.

To increase performance : template inheritance, jquery and nginx.
3rd party integrations: alerify js, fast sms, paypal,  chart js.
